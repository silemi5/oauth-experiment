OAuth2 for Authorization


Flow for Authorization code
1. [ Login with HOV ]
2. [ Login (with necessary parameters for Authorization) ]
3. [ Server checks if credential is valid ]
4. [ Server issues unique authorization code and redirects user to specified redirect_uri  ]
  Server should store:
    - user ID
    - scope of the authorization code
  The identifier is the code itself
  This code SHOULD be shortlived (around 10minutes) [Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42346476/oauth-2-authorization-code-how-long-is-it-valid]


Flow for the access token (To be reworked)
1. [ Client app sents authorization code ]
2. [ Server validates if code is valid ]
3. [ Server gives access code ]
